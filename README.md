Minimal vim colorscheme

![Example with gruvbox terminal colors](example.png?raw=true "Example with gruvbox colors")â†©

I find most colorschemes to be too colorful which defeats the point of quickly distinguishing key terms in your code.
This theme attempts to cut down on the menagerie of colors and only highlight key terms in a yellows and blues which should be colorblind friendly.

**Code with the wind at your side!**

### Font requirements

This theme is only designed for the terminal (ideally a color terminal).
You should have your terminal configured with a normal and bold font.
An italic font is nice but not required.

### Colors
The two versions of the theme (flynn and darkflynn) are for light and dark terminal colorschemes.
All colors are pulled from your terminal colorscheme.

### Installation

To install the theme you can simply add the files to the ~/.vim/colors/ directory (make it if you don't have it on your system already).
Then you can put **colorscheme flynn** in you vimrc to load it everytime you launch vim.

### Future plans

This is a very simple and unrefined theme but I'll continue to update and expand it as the need arises.
